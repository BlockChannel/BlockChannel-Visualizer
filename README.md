Bits Blockchain Visualizer

This actually came out of my frustration when waiting for confirmations, I wanted something nice to look at, and added the sound notification for notice when in another tab. I hope some of you find it useful.

Uses websockets from blockchain.info, which can be laggy at times, causing delay between updates.
